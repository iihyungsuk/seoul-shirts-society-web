## Name Magic Numbers

**Rule:** Replace magic numbers with named constants for clarity.

**Reasoning:**

- Improves clarity by giving semantic meaning to unexplained values
- Enhances maintainability by centralizing constant values
- Makes code self-documenting

**Guidelines:**
- Use descriptive names that explain the purpose
- Include units in the name (MS, PX, PERCENT, etc.)
- Group related constants together

#### Recommended Pattern:

```typescript
const ANIMATION_DELAY_MS = 300;

async function onLikeClick() {
  await postLike(url);
  await delay(ANIMATION_DELAY_MS); // Clearly indicates waiting for animation
  await refetchPostLike();
}
```

#### Avoid:

```typescript
async function onLikeClick() {
  await postLike(url);
  await delay(300); // What does 300 represent?
  await refetchPostLike();
}
```
